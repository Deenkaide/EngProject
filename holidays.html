                    <p class="text-small smt_kalyady">From late December to January, groups of villagers dress up in costumes and go from house to house singing traditional caroling songs. The motley cast of characters usually includes a goat, a symbol of fertility and energy, as well as a horse, an old woman, a grandfather, and a gypsy. The crowd moves from east to west, following the sun, and knocking on every door. Each visit consists of three parts: welcoming the owners of the house, performing traditional games and songs, and receiving delicious treats.</p>
